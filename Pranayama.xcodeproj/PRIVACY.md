# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-01-20

Pranayama Helper ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Pranayama Helper mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the App.

## Information We Collect
We may collect the following categories of information depending on your App usage and settings:
- Contact Information (e.g., email address) if you contact support or create an account.
- Usage Data (e.g., app interactions, diagnostics, crash logs) to improve performance and reliability.
- Identifiers (e.g., device identifiers) for app functionality and analytics.
- [Optional: Location, Photos, Contacts, Health, or other sensitive data] — only if your App requests and you grant permission. Be specific about what you collect here.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent age in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Provide and maintain the App’s core functionality.
- Improve the App, diagnose issues, and analyze performance.
- Communicate with you about updates, support, or important notices.
- [Optional: Personalize content or advertising, if applicable.]

## Sharing of Information
We may share information with:
- Service providers who assist with hosting, analytics, customer support, or other operational needs and who are bound by confidentiality obligations.
- Legal authorities when required to comply with the law or protect our rights.

We do not sell your personal information. If your jurisdiction defines "sale" broadly (e.g., under CCPA/CPRA), describe your practices and opt-out mechanisms if applicable.

## Data Retention
We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes described above or as required by law. When no longer needed, we delete or anonymize information in a reasonable timeframe.

## Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal information. To exercise these rights, contact us at the email address below. You can also manage certain permissions in your device settings (e.g., Location, Photos).

## Security
We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## International Transfers
Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards for such transfers.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy with a new effective date. Your continued use of the App after changes become effective means you accept the revised policy.
